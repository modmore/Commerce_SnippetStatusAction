SnippetStatusAction for [Commerce](https://modmore.com/commerce/)
--------------------------------

Allows you to run a simple MODX snippet whenever a status change is executed. Saves you from having to write a custom extension, though you'll still need that snippet.

After enabling the module, navigate to Configuration > Statuses and click on the name of the status change you want to add the action to. Choose to add a Snippet Status Change Action, and enter the name of the snippet in the configuration.
